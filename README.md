# Spelly

Hey ya'll this is a project I made to learn more about Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Drizzle ORM. My friends and I came up with this game back in 7th grade and always argued about the rules (which word is valid, are business names considered valid, that's not how you spell that word etc, etc). Now most of those points of debate are gone since all that's handled by this app (hallelujah). The working demo should be up at [spelly.org](https://www.spelly.org); if there are issues with functionality, that might be because the Supabase project is paused due to inactivity lol. Thank you for checking it out and please enjoy the rest of this AI-generated readme.

Spelly is an interactive multiplayer word game built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Supabase**. Players take turns adding letters to a growing word, trying to avoid being the one who can't continue the sequence. The goal is to accumulate the fewest points and outlast your opponents!

## ðŸŽ® Game Rules

1. Players take turns adding one letter to form a word.
2. A player **must** add a valid letter that keeps the word forming.
3. If a player cannot add a valid letter, they receive a point.

5. The player with the **least** points at the end wins!
